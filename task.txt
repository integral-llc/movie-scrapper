Create a NodeJS +TypeScript using Express web-server with a scheduler to run various tasks.

Task1
Parse a given folder, read it from movies.txt for all files, recursivelly for move files.
Find movie files by popular file extentions. 
Movie names can be written in any common language. 
They need to be translated to English correctly by their original name from IMDB.
You can use OpenAI or recomend another translation engine. 
After the movie is 100% detected, it file name must be in format 
Full Movie Name (YEAR) (IMDB XX).ext - i.e. The Ninth Gate (1999) (IMDB 4.6).mkv
Fir parsed movie keep a local SQLite database.
Movies can be deleted or added o er time, DB must be always in Sync. 
The task shall be executed every 12 hours or via a call to the web-server.
If the movie country of origin Russia or Romania, write the name file name in russian or romanian.
Everything else must be in English.


The system must be easily extendable to add other tasks.


Use DRY, SOLID and Ganf of Four Patterns at a primcipal developer level.

If something is unclear, ask, do not guess.

1. use anything that is free and reliable. let me know where I shall get the API key if needed
2. one folder name per line. it doesn't exists yet. 
3. yes, all common movie name format. in Some cases the movie is a BDRip, meaning is a folder with rip files. in this case, only the base folder will be renamed
4. use google translate. AWS root creds are already in the system, create anotehr set of creds only for the translation service
5. yes, clean all, it must be in format - The Ninth Gate (1999) (IMDB 4.6).mkv
6. rename on disk, fail gracefully if not possible
7. yes use Cyrillic/Romanina. Use the main country 
8. 9988
9. a good enough schema to track new, existing and deleted movie names 
10. Also, this for the Kodi application. if you know exactly that a poster image can be created and correctly shown by KOdi, then create it.
