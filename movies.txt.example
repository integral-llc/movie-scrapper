# Movie Scrapper - Folder Configuration
# Add one movie folder path per line
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored

# Example paths (update these to your actual movie directories):
# /Users/username/Movies
# /Volumes/External/Movies
# /mnt/nas/media/movies

# You can add as many folders as needed
# The scanner will recursively search all subdirectories
